Our New Awesome Piece Of Software

We're very happy to announce the creation of this project: ONAPOS

It's a simple collections manager written in Java.

Features:
 - create any kind of collection easily and quickly: books, movies, magazines, you name it!
 - infinite possibilities for meta data - fancy making a record of all the scribbles you write in the margins of books? simply add a "margin-scribbles" field and record away!
 - low memory footprint
 - (planned) easy sorting and filtering of collections

Known bugs:
 - see Issues on the github page (github.com/cjbrowne/Onapos)
